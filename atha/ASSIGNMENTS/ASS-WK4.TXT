THREE FRIENDS WHO LOVE EACH OTHER A LOT ALWAYS HAVE SWEETS FROM THEIR PARENTS. WHATS THEY DO IS ADD EVERYBODY'S SWEETS AND THEN SHARE THEM EQUALLY AMONGST THEM SELVES AND THEN CRUSH THE REMAINDER. PLEASE CREATE A SMALL PROGRAM TO AID THE FRIENDS CALCULATE EACH PERSONS SHARE.

>>>FRIEND5_SWEETS = 6

YOUR RESULT CAN BE AS SUCH 

>>> HELLO GUYS, EACH OF YOU SHOULD GET 5SWEETS AND 2 SHOULD BE DISCARDED
